# Applied Behavioral UX

**A research-grounded 5-layer framework for evaluating and designing user experiences using behavioral science.**

Unlike style-focused UX guides, this framework applies peer-reviewed findings from psychology, behavioral economics, and neuroscience directly to product decisions.

## The Framework

```
Layer 1 — Perception (How users SEE)
  Gestalt · Yarbus · Fitts · Visual Hierarchy · Attention · Emotional Design · Processing Fluency
       ↓
Layer 2 — Cognition (How users THINK)
  Cognitive Load · Miller · Mental Models · Hick · Information Foraging · Zeigarnik · Flow
       ↓
Layer 3 — Decision Making (How users CHOOSE)
  Prospect Theory · Loss Aversion · Nudge · Choice Architecture · Cialdini · Hyperbolic Discounting
       ↓
Layer 4 — Motivation (Why users ACT)
  Self-Determination Theory · Goal Theory · Habit Formation · Peak-End Rule · Social Identity
       ↓
Layer 5 — Product Behavior (What the product DOES)
  Activation · Onboarding · Retention · Conversion · Trust · Pricing
```

### Mobile Considerations

Mobile is not just "smaller desktop" — several behavioral dynamics are genuinely unique to mobile devices. The framework includes cross-layer mobile principles based on research:

- **Thumb Zone Reachability** — 49% one-handed / 36% cradle / 15% two-handed (Hoober, 2013; n=1,333)
- **Divided Attention as Baseline** — mobile use frequently occurs while walking, in transit, or multitasking
- **Screen Size as Natural Progressive Disclosure** — smaller screens can produce lower cognitive load (Al-Mushasha et al., 2021; n=1,570)
- **Smartphone "Brain Drain"** — the mere presence of a phone reduces cognitive capacity (Ward et al., 2017)
- **Lower Abandonment Cost** — alternative apps are one tap away

## How to Use

Add this skill to your AI coding agent (ZCode, Cursor, etc.) and it will automatically activate when you ask for UX evaluations, design reviews, conversion optimization, or behavioral analysis.

### Evaluate a product
Share a URL, screenshot, or describe the interface. The framework walks through all 5 layers — perception, cognition, decision making, motivation, and product behavior — scoring each and delivering prioritized recommendations.

### Design a new feature
Describe what you're building. The framework works bottom-up from behavioral outcomes (Layer 5) to visual execution (Layer 1), ensuring every design decision is grounded in research.

### Debug a specific problem
Jump straight to the relevant layer:
- **Low conversion?** → Layer 3 (Decision Making)
- **Users can't find things?** → Layer 2 (Cognition)
- **Churn after signup?** → Layer 5 (Activation/Onboarding)
- **Declining engagement?** → Layer 4 (Motivation)
- **Visual design issues?** → Layer 1 (Perception)

## Ethical Use

This framework describes how human psychology works. It includes ethical guardrails:

- **Dark patterns violate the framework itself** — They undermine Autonomy (Layer 4)
- **Nudge ≠ Manipulate** — Nudges preserve freedom of choice
- **Loss aversion is a tool, not a weapon** — Fabricating losses (false urgency, fake scarcity) is not a nudge
- **Variable rewards become addiction when users lose control** — Design for engagement, not compulsion

## Contributing

Found a missing paper? Have a UX insight backed by research? PRs welcome — especially:

- Additional peer-reviewed papers mapped to the appropriate layer
- Real-world case studies applying specific principles
- Cross-cultural considerations for any principle
- Counter-examples where a principle doesn't hold
- Mobile-specific behavioral research
