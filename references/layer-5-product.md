# Layer 5 — Product Behavior: Deep Reference

## Activation — Deep Patterns

### Brian Bafour's Framework (HubSpot / Reforge)

**The "Really Good Feature":**
- A single feature that, when used, is strongly correlated with long-term retention
- This feature MUST be reachable within the first session
- The entire activation strategy should be: get the user to the Really Good Feature as fast as possible

**How to find your Really Good Feature:**
1. Identify users who retained >30 days
2. Look at what actions they took in their first 7 days
3. Find the action(s) most correlated with retention
4. That's your Really Good Feature
5. Optimize everything to get new users to that feature

### Activation Funnel Optimization

**The Activation Funnel:**
```
Sign-up → Setup → First Action → "Aha!" Moment → Value Realization
```

**Conversion Targets:**
| Stage | Benchmark (Consumer) | Benchmark (B2B SaaS) |
|---|---|---|
| Sign-up → Setup | 80-90% | 70-80% |
| Setup → First Action | 60-70% | 50-60% |
| First Action → "Aha!" | 40-50% | 30-40% |
| "Aha!" → Value Realization | 70-80% | 60-70% |

**Techniques:**
1. **Skip unnecessary steps** — Pre-fill, use templates, import data, offer OAuth sign-in
2. **Progressive value** — Don't wait until setup is "complete" to show value. Show it at every step.
3. **Template-driven onboarding** — "Start with this pre-made project" is faster than "create from scratch"
4. **Magic moment engineering** — Identify the emotional peak of value delivery and optimize the path to it
5. **Guided to self-guided transition** — Start with guidance, then get out of the way

### Time-to-Value Benchmarks

| Product Type | Target TTV |
|---|---|
| Consumer mobile app | < 60 seconds |
| SaaS tool | < 3 minutes |
| Enterprise software | < 30 minutes |
| Developer tool | < 5 minutes (to first working example) |

## Onboarding — Patterns Catalog

### Type 1: Value-First Onboarding
**Show value before asking for anything.**
- Pattern: User experiences the product immediately (no account needed)
- Examples: Google Maps (search without account), Spotify (listen without account)
- When to use: When the core value can be demonstrated in seconds

### Type 2: Guided Task Onboarding
**Walk through a real task, not a tutorial.**
- Pattern: "Let's create your first project" (not "Welcome to the dashboard")
- Each step delivers actual value, not just teaches a feature
- Examples: Notion's first page creation, Canva's first design
- When to use: When the product requires setup but the core value is clear

### Type 3: Progressive Onboarding
**Teach features contextually as needed.**
- Pattern: No upfront tutorial. Tooltips appear on first use of each feature.
- Examples: Slack (no tutorial — just messages with contextual tips)
- When to use: For products with many features where most are secondary

### Type 4: Progressive Investment Onboarding
**Start with minimal asks, deepen engagement as value is demonstrated.**
- Pattern: Core action first → optional enrichment later (profile, connections, preferences)
- Each investment ask should come AFTER the user has experienced corresponding value
- Examples: Slack (start messaging, add integrations as you need them), Figma (start designing, invite collaborators when sharing)
- Key principle: Never ask for investment before the user has received value
- When to use: When network effects and data richness drive value

### Anti-Patterns in Onboarding

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Forced tutorial that can't be skipped | Violates autonomy (Layer 4) | Make every tutorial step optional |
| "Features tour" before value | Users don't care about features yet | Show value first, features second |
| Too many steps (>5) | Cognitive load + friction | Cut to 3-5 maximum steps |
| Asking for permissions upfront | Users deny reflexively | Ask in context when the feature is needed |
| Generic welcome messages | No information scent | Personalize from signup data |
| Empty state on first login | Feels broken, not new | Pre-populate with example data/templates |

## Retention — Deep Frameworks

### Dave McClure's AARRR Framework (Retention Focus)

```
Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Referral → Revenue
                                ↑
                    Where the real business is built
```

**Retention Benchmarks:**
| Day | Consumer App (Good) | SaaS (Good) |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | 40-60% | 70-80% |
| D7 | 20-30% | 50-60% |
| D30 | 10-15% | 30-40% |
| D90 | 5-10% | 20-30% |

### Cohort Analysis Questions
- Which cohort retains best? What did they do differently?
- Is there a "smile curve" (retention dips then recovers)?
- What's the activation action for best-retaining users?

### Retention Levers (Ordered by Impact)

1. **Habit formation** — Build repeated context-dependent behavior (Layer 4)
2. **Switching costs** — Increase stored value (data, connections, integrations)
3. **Network effects** — Make the product more valuable with each additional user
4. **Personalization** — The longer they use it, the better it works for them
5. **Content/investment loop** — Users create content they don't want to lose
6. **Social bonds** — Users build relationships within the product

### Churn Signals
- Decreased engagement frequency
- Reduced feature usage breadth
- Support ticket spikes
- No engagement with core "Really Good Feature" in 7+ days
- Account settings changes (often precedes cancellation)

## Conversion — Funnel Optimization

### The Conversion Funnel

```
Awareness → Interest → Consideration → Intent → Purchase
```

### Common Conversion Killers

| Stage | Killer | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Interest → Consideration | No clear value proposition | Lead with outcomes, not features |
| Consideration → Intent | No social proof | Add testimonials, user counts, logos |
| Intent → Purchase | Friction in checkout/payment | Reduce fields, offer multiple payment methods |
| Any stage | Missing pricing transparency | Show pricing upfront (builds trust) |
| Any stage | No urgency or reason to act now | Use ethical scarcity, deadlines, limited offers |

### Upgrade Prompt Timing

**Best moments to ask for upgrade:**
1. Just completed a task successfully (competence high, motivation high)
2. Hit a limit for the first time (friction creates desire)
3. Viewing pricing page (obvious intent signal)
4. Repeated use signals (power user detection)
5. Compared features across tiers (explicit interest)

**Worst moments to ask:**
1. During onboarding (user hasn't experienced value yet)
2. After an error or frustration moment
3. During a flow the user is trying to complete (interruptive)
4. Too frequently (more than once per session)

### Pricing Page Patterns

**The Three-Tier Structure:**
```
┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│   Starter    │  │   Pro ★     │  │  Enterprise │
│   $9/mo     │  │   $29/mo    │  │   Custom    │
│             │  │ (highlighted)│  │             │
│  Basic      │  │  Everything │  │  Everything │
│  features   │  │  in Starter  │  │  in Pro +   │
│             │  │  + Advanced  │  │  Priority   │
│             │  │  + Priority │  │  Support    │
└─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘
```

**Anchoring Techniques:**
- Show monthly price AND annual price ("$29/mo or $290/year — save $58")
- Show "value" of the product ("$500 worth of features for $29/mo")
- Show competitor comparison with your price lower

**Conversion Optimization Checklist:**
- [ ] Tier count appropriate for your market and pricing model (3 is common but not mandatory)
- [ ] Recommended tier visually prominent through design treatment, not just a badge
- [ ] Monthly vs. annual toggle with savings highlighted
- [ ] Feature comparison table
- [ ] Social proof on the page
- [ ] FAQ section for objections
- [ ] Money-back guarantee or free trial CTA
- [ ] No hidden fees visible
- [ ] Enterprise tier as "Contact us" (captures leads, signals premium)

## Trust — Building Framework

### Trust Equation
```
Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Orientation
```
- **Credibility** — Expertise and knowledge (professional design, accurate information)
- **Reliability** — Consistency and dependability (uptime, consistent behavior)
- **Intimacy** — Safety and comfort (privacy, security, personalization)
- **Self-Orientation** — Perceived motivation (profit-driven vs. user-focused). Lower is better.

### Trust Signals by Layer

| Layer | Trust Signals |
|---|---|
| Layer 1 (Perception) | Professional design, no errors, consistent branding |
| Layer 2 (Cognition) | Clear language, predictable behavior, transparent structure |
| Layer 3 (Decision) | Honest pricing, no dark patterns, clear defaults |
| Layer 4 (Motivation) | Respecting autonomy, no manipulation, genuine care |
| Layer 5 (Product) | Uptime, data security, responsive support, privacy |

### Trust-Building Actions

**First Impression (0-10 seconds):**
- Professional visual design (non-negotiable)
- No typos, broken images, or loading errors
- Clear branding and URL
- HTTPS, security badges

**First Interaction (10-60 seconds):**
- Responsive interface (speed = competence)
- Clear, helpful language
- Working navigation
- Reasonable request for permissions

**Ongoing Trust:**
- Consistent behavior (same action → same result)
- Transparent communication (explain outages, changes)
- Easy to reach support (chat, email, phone)
- Data portability (users can export their data)
- No surprise charges or policy changes

### Trust Destruction Events

| Event | Trust Impact | Recovery Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| Data breach | Severe | Immediate transparency, fix, and compensation |
| Hidden charges | Severe | Full refund + apology + policy change |
| Downtime | Moderate | Communication during + post-mortem published |
| Broken promises | Moderate | Acknowledge and recommit |
| Poor support | Moderate | Escalate and resolve quickly |
| Privacy concerns | Variable | Transparent data policy + user controls |

## Pricing Psychology — Advanced Patterns

### Charm Pricing Research
- **$9.99 vs $10.00:** Effective for purchases under $100. The left-digit effect makes $9.99 feel like "$9 and change" not "basically $10."
- **For premium products:** Round numbers work better. $1,000 feels more premium than $999.
- **Subscription pricing:** $29/mo feels significantly less than $30/mo due to left-digit effect.

### Pain of Paying (Raworth, 2016)
The psychological discomfort of spending depends on:
1. **Salience** — Cash is more painful than credit card (more salient)
2. **Timing** — Paying now is more painful than paying later
3. **Bundle vs. itemize** — A single bundled price hurts less than itemized

**Applications:**
- Annual billing: $290/year hurts less than 12 × $29/mo (single payment vs. repeated)
- Credits/tokens: "50 credits" abstracts away real dollar amounts
- Bundled features: "All features for $29" hurts less than "$10 for A + $8 for B + $11 for C"

### Per-Day and Per-Month Framing
For annual billing, show the total annual price alongside the effective monthly cost (e.g., "$290/year ($24/mo)") to make the value tangible. Highlight savings from annual billing explicitly ("$58 savings vs monthly"). For high-value products, frame the price against the value delivered ("$290/year to save 10+ hours/month") rather than reducing it to daily increments, which can feel condescending to professional buyers. Test whether daily, monthly, or value-based framing resonates with your specific audience.

### Feature Presentation
- **Bundle features** into themes ("Analytics Suite" not "Charts + Graphs + Reports + Filters")
- **Name features** descriptively ("Smart Scheduling" not "Algorithm-based calendar optimization")
- **Show outcomes** ("Save 5 hours/week" not "Automated workflow builder")

### Price Anchoring in Practice
1. Start with the most expensive option or show the "full value"
2. Reveal discounts relative to the anchor
3. Use anchoring to show value — display the regular price alongside the discounted price using your design system's treatment. For premium products, consider subtle anchors (annual vs monthly side-by-side) over prominent strikethroughs, which can feel discount-retail rather than premium. Test different visual treatments for your audience
4. Show per-unit pricing for bulk purchases
5. Visually distinguish the recommended tier through subtle design treatment (highlighted border, elevated shadow, slightly larger scale) rather than heavy-handed badges. Many modern products (Linear, Vercel, Raycast) avoid explicit badges entirely and let visual hierarchy speak
